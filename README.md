  # Stripe Payment Integration in a React App
  Author Roland Sz≈ëke wrote a beginner's tutorial for integrating
  Stripe credit card payments into a React application on January 29,
  2019 in a
  [RisingStack](https://blog.risingstack.com/stripe-payments-integration-tutorial-javascript/)
  blog post.

  ## Outlined and Indexing

  I have taken that article and outlined and indexed it into a Texinfo
  form using Emacs Orgmode, leaving most of the content unchanged.  I
  have provided an Info document, a PDF document, and an HTML document
  for reference.

  ## Create a Working Version
  The next step is to create a single source Orgmode document that
  will reproduce the project and publish it to a working prototype.
